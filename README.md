# Interactive Periodic Table

## Introduction
This is an interactive periodic table built using the Pygame library. It provides a visually appealing and educational way to explore the elements of the periodic table. This README will guide you through the setup, features, and customization options of the application.

## Features
- **Interactive Elements**: Click on an element to view its details, including its name, symbol, atomic number, and atomic weight.
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Elements are color-coded to represent their categories, making it easy to identify groups like noble gases, transition metals, and more.
- **Educational Information**: Detailed information about each element.

# Data Management
The data for this interactive periodic table is sourced from Wikipedia and is stored in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This allows for easy customization and updating of the periodic table's content. Follow these steps to manage and modify the data:

## Updating Data
CSV File: Locate the CSV file named Periodic Data.csv in the project directory. This file contains the elemental data used by the application.

Edit CSV: Open the CSV file using a text editor or spreadsheet software. You will find rows of data representing each element, with columns for properties like name, symbol, atomic number, and atomic weight.

Update Data: Make any necessary changes or updates to the data in the CSV file. You can add new elements, modify existing ones, or adjust properties to reflect the most current information.


## Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
   ```shell
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
